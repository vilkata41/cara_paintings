# Cara's Paintings Shop

This website was a project I created during my third year in university.

## Technologies used

Since the main idea of this project was to expand knowledge on PHP, the website mainly used that language and was hosted on the servers of the university. It also used JavaScript for page interactivity.

## Project specifics

The general page acts as a "client" page where one can look for paintings to purchase. There is also a hidden admin page which could be accessed only by entering the correct password. The paintings are not purchaseable in real life but an email is sent to the client with the confirmation of the purchase.

<b>It is important to unzip node_modules before using the website since it contains used libraries in the application.</b>
